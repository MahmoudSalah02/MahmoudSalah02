## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mahmoud, a 3rd-year Computer Science student at Brandeis University. I'm currently interning as a Data Scientist for [Brandeis Institutional Advancement](https://alumni.brandeis.edu/about/index.html) building Machine Learning models to identify potential Major Donors! Last Summer '23, I interned at [EXALT](https://www.exalt-tech.com/) as a Backend Engineer Intern where I designed and created an API for a Cafe (see [Cup of Joy](https://github.com/MahmoudSalah02/Cup-of-Joy)). I was also part of the [Headstarter Fellowship](https://www.theheadstarter.com/) Summer '23, where I built a Web Application Tracking System (see [Resume Parser](https://github.com/MahmoudSalah02/resume-parser))

## ðŸ”­ Some things I've worked on:

- [Kiwi Be Friends](https://github.com/MahmoudSalah02/kiwibefriends): a platform to rate, review and share restaurants with friends

- [Cup of Joy](https://github.com/MahmoudSalah02/Cup-of-Joy): RESTful API for a Cafe that allows employees to take customers' orders 

- [RoomFinder](https://wavechat.tech): a web app that assists students in the housing selection process at Brandeis
