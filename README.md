## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mahmoud, a 3rd-year Computer Science undergrad at Brandeis University. I am currently sharpening my data science skills at [Brandeis Institutional Advancement](https://alumni.brandeis.edu/about/index.html), where I build Machine Learning models to spot potential major donors!

Previously in the Summer of '23, I delved into backend development at [EXALT](https://www.exalt-tech.com/) as an intern. I designed and implemented a RESTful API for a cafe management system - you can check it out at "[Cup of Joy](https://github.com/MahmoudSalah02/Cup-of-Joy)"! Around the same time, I also had the opportunity to participate in the [Headstarter Fellowship](https://www.theheadstarter.com/), where I developed a web-based Application Tracking System. Take a peek at it under "[Resume Parser](https://github.com/MahmoudSalah02/resume-parser)".

#### Here are a few projects that I've had a blast working on:

- [Kiwi Be Friends](https://github.com/MahmoudSalah02/kiwibefriends): An engaging platform where you can rate, review, and share your favorite restaurants with friends.

- [Cup of Joy](https://github.com/MahmoudSalah02/Cup-of-Joy): A RESTful API for managing cafe operations, from employee assignments to fulfilling customer orders.

- [RoomFinder](https://github.com/MahmoudSalah02/RoomFinder): A practical web app aimed at simplifying the housing selection process for Brandeis students.
